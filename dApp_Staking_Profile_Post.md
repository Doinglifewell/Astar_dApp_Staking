The DeStore platform aims to facilitate the adoption and management of Hybrid assets, which are physical assets connected to a **Digital Twin**. NFT technology for product based settlement, DeStore enables the creation, 
management, and trading of these assets, with the goal of providing pathways for small to medium enterprises (**SMEs**), **Creators**, and decentralized autonomous organizations (**DAOs**) to expand their brand 
and sell real-world products on web 3.0 infrastructure.

## About DeAR?
DeAR is a user-friendly wallet with advanced AR features, a part of DeStore's strategic solution for onboarding 'nocoiners.' DeAR aims to bring Web 3 to billions through existing e-commerce channels, introducing them to digital twins (NFTs) and cryptocurrencies such as Astar without the burden of KYC.
 
Dear will be used alongside Digital Twin Claim Cards (DTCCs). These physical cards allow "nocoiners" to download DeAR by scanning the card and automatically claim digital twins of their real-world items. DeStore's goal is to provide an intuitive solution for the easy redemption of these digital twins. 
Establishing new users of the Astar Network

## Decentralized Commerce (DeCom): 

With the widespread adoption of digitization of Real World Assets (RWAs), DeStore plans to greatly impact the way tokenised assets are managed and utilized via the Hybrid Asset. DeStores advanced NFT payment system allows Real-time monitoring and optimization of performance, maintenance, and 
settlement of assets can be achieved, as well as the autonomy of exchanging all product information at the point of sale of underlying assets

## Methods:

DeStore utilizes static digital twins and tokenization to represent the underlying physical assets. Digital twins allow for real-time monitoring and analysis of assets, while tokenization enables the creation of 
smart contracts for efficient automation of processes and reduces the need for intermediaries. By combining multiple digital files to a single asset, the platform allows for flexibility in asset representation across 
different platforms and the transfer of product information at the point of sale.

DeStore is offering 1% of its ***Equity*** into a pool for stakers who stake more than 25,000 ASTR for at least 5 out of 6 months with a goal of raising 100,000,000 Staked ASTR. Stakers have a 5 - 6-month window from January 1 to June 30, 2024, to stake their ASTR, with a 
one-month grace period to unstake. If 150,000,000 staked ASTR is reached DeStore will release a further 1% totaling 2% for the first 6 month period  ***Equity*** allocation will be based on the average amount of ASTR staked during the six months. DeStore will also allocate 
a further 1% for the second half of 2024 with the same rules. All stakers can gain access to DeStore's Discord channel, which will transition into a DeStore OGs Channel on the last day of January 2024.
