## DeStore Build-to-Earn Proposal


We are excited to present our Build-to-Earn proposal and seek support from the Astar Community. Our proposal aims to attract a minimum of 100,000,000 ASTR through DApp staking, with the yield payable to: 

> **DeStore B2E Wallet (Substrate):**
> XdFFaA9S31uQ9upPyKBGXcrYhFN7jtBkDYLDbDfc1VKaV8W


. 
This Funding support will enable DeStore's Development of DeAR and establishment in Japan by collaborating with e-LogiT, a leading Japanese third-party logistics provider, and onboarding Japanese enterprise into web3 via the launch of its new product that is 
currently in development DeAR, a simple Wallet with advanced Sony AR functionalities and product verification tooling.
The DeAR initiative seeks to onboard web3-curious brands in Japan onto the Astar Network. We plan to provide existing eCommerce brands with Physical Digital Twin Claim Cards (DTCCs) that can be inserted into product packaging. When the product is purchased via 
conventional eCommerce channels by "No Coiners," the new owner can claim the product's Digital Twin through the DeAR wallet download and an automatic DT Airdrop.

### What is DeAR?
DeAR is a user-friendly wallet with advanced AR features, a part of DeStore's strategic solution for onboarding 'nocoiners.' DeAR aims to bring Web 3 to billions through existing e-commerce channels, introducing them to digital twins (NFTs) and cryptocurrencies 
such as Astar without the burden of KYC.

### What is DTCC?
DTCC stands for Digital Twin Claim Cards. These physical cards allow "nocoiners" to download DeAR by scanning the card and automatically claim digital twins of their real-world items. DeStore's goal is to provide an intuitive solution for the easy redemption of 
these digital twins. 
Establishing new users of the Astar Network

## Problem Statement 

Entering Web 3 can be challenging for non-coiners. They must navigate a complex sea of crypto information, set up wallets, address security concerns, deal with unfamiliar interfaces, and grapple with regulatory uncertainty and fees, all while grasping the concept 
of decentralization. This complexity and the need for more user-friendly resources can deter new users and hinder Web 3's growth. To ease this transition, various projects and organizations are focused on enhancing interfaces, providing clearer educational materials, 
and creating user-friendly tools. The goal is to simplify the journey into Web 3 and enhance the user experience.









### Proposed Solution

DeAR is a user-friendly wallet designed to facilitate the entry of newcomers, or "nocoiners," into the world of Web 3. It streamlines the typically intricate processes associated with Web 3, including KYC onboarding, DeFi participation, and digital asset management. 
DeAR also introduces users to digital twins (NFTs), allowing them to claim digital representations of their real-world assets. By making Web 3 more accessible through familiar e-commerce 
channels, DeAR eliminates the technical barriers and complexities that often discourage new users. This user-friendly approach aligns with DeStore's mission to empower brands, making it simpler for them to navigate the challenges of the Web 3 landscape and effectively 
engage with their audience.

Once a “No Coiner” has a Coin, they can research more and learn the ins and outs of Web 3 as they have invested interest. 


### Benefits and Impact

The partnership between DeStore Network and Astar Network promises several significant outcomes and benefits, mutually contributing to the growth and objectives of both entities:

- Expansion of Astar's ecosystem
- Increased stakeholders in the Astar Network
- Empowerment and innovation
- Simplified entry for Web 3-curious enterprises
- The potential to power Japan's $210 billion e-commerce market with Astar.













### What is in it for the Stakers? 


DeStore is offering 1% of its equity into a pool for stakers who stake more than 25,000 ASTR for at least 5 out of 6 months with a goal of raising 100,000,000 Staked ASTR. Stakers have a 5 - 6-month window from January 1 to June 30, 2024, to stake their ASTR, with a 
one-month grace period to unstake. If 150,000,000 staked ASTR is reached DeStore will release a further 1% totaling 2% for the first 6 month period  Equity allocation will be based on the average amount of ASTR staked during the six months. DeStore will also allocate 
a further 1% for the second half of 2024 with the same rules. All stakers with over 25K ASTR will gain access to DeStore's Exclusive Discord channel, which will transition to the OGs Channel on the last day of January 2024.
Simplified Explanation:
Imagine you have a pie representing the 2% equity. Each staker gets a slice of the pie based on how much ASTR they staked. The more ASTR you staked, the bigger your slice of the DeStore pie.
What is in it for the Community? 

Along with the DT airdrops, DeStore will also Airdrop ¥100 worth of $ASTR, converting no coiner into ASTR stakeholders and dramatically expanding the ecosystem. 


### Equity Allocation Reporting
The round will close on July 30, 2024, and DeStore will provide a report within 30 days with each stakeholder's equity allocation of shares. Stakeholders must provide personal information to claim equity in DeStore's parent company, Metarock Ltd, registered in 
the British Virgin Islands.

### How will the Equity be distributed? 
Equity claim button will be made available in the DeStore Platform - Stakers will be able to claim their equity as Free Private shares of DeStore’s Parent Company MetaRock Ltd, Registered in the British Virgin Islands once the 6 month Period is over

BVI Company Number 2129177

## Roadmap


Astar Live Trials: DeStore has teamed up with an Astar Native DAO to conduct live drop shipping trials out of DeStore’s warehouse in Australia. These trials will allow us to test and gain community feedback on the DeStore platform and the user experience. 
Internal Drop shipping trials video on Astar - Link


### DeAR Community Trials:  
Will launch in March 2024 with internal testing involving all stakeholders on Astar Network and Astar zkEVM. All Eligible participants will receive the first batch of DTCCs via the DeStore marketplace shipped directly to your address. 

### Digital Twin Minting Standard: 
DeStore is building an alliance with prominent brands to build a Digital Twin standard to allow the ecosystem to build infrastructure around web3 commerce.

### DeAR Public Launch: 
After internal testing and community feedback, we will select 3-5 Astar native Web 3 brands and pair them with established Japanese e-commerce brands through eLogIT’s client introductions. This collaboration will result in the release of hybrid products using DTCCs. 
Once 3-5 case studies have been done, DeStore will make Available to all e-Logistic clients to onboard 100 enterprise brands by July. Web 3 brands in the Astar ecosystem interested in getting exposure in RWAs for DeStore are advised to 
express interest via this form - Link.


### DeStore 2.0: 
Once a Digital Twin Minting Standard is established, DeStore will upgrade to Ink!

IRL checkout Beta: we are still exploring what this will look like; however, the vision is to watch this video of what IRL purchase could look like - Link

### How will DeStore/DeAR generate revenue?
During the first 24 months, DeAR will focus on expanding its user base and being the first mover in the Polkadot ecosystem, Astar/Astar zkEVM, Pioneer, Energy Web X, Sony Blockchain, and many more, providing solutions to onboard new users. However, DeAR will not 
generate any in-app revenue during this time. It will offer a smooth and enjoyable onboarding experience for non-crypto users.
DeStore will empower Web3 brands seeking to onboard new users into their ecosystem by claiming their products' Digital Twin, effectively onboarding a new user to the blockchain of the Brands of choice.
Once the product market fit for DeStore and DeAR stabilizes, we will connect DeStore's backend to DeAR. After this upgrade is established, DeAR will act as a "reseller" of DeStore, and revenue will be derived from settlement fees. At this point, ToF will serve as 
key infrastructure for AR-based sales. DeStore aims to charge a minimum of $2.50 USD and a maximum of 6%, plus consulting fees.
Mobile Resellers Applications of DeStore will earn approximately 30% of DeStore's settlement fee from in-wallet purchases via DeStore. Access to ToF will be extended to other third-party mobile wallet providers via DeStore. 
Wallets such as Novasama, Subwallet, Talisman and AEM+  have already expressed interest.

### Total Addressable Market (TAM)

## DeStore
During the initial stages, DeStore will focus on building a highly scalable and appealing product accessible to everyone. We will focus on the countries where we have the strongest connections, initially targeting Australia and Japan due to their size and 
proximity to our team.
DeStore will primarily appeal to web3 native users in the Polkadot ecosystem, so it is hard to calculate a TAM equal to that of Polkadot ecosystem brands. However, we believe that DeStore has the potential to expand beyond the Polkadot ecosystem and attract a 
broader audience of users, including those with no prior experience in the cryptocurrency realm.
DeAR
DeAR will have a TAM equal to that of the global e-commerce economy ($6.3 Trillion) as it can be manually integrated into packaging and therefore accompany any product being sold on any e-commerce platform globally. However  In the first 12-24 months, we will 
focus on Australia ($43 Billion) and Japan's $210 billion e-commerce market, strategically positioning ourselves alongside e-LogIT (Japan) and Future Fulfillment (Australia) scaling accordingly.
DeAR's target market includes both e-commerce businesses and consumers. The company will focus on providing businesses with a seamless and secure solution for integrating DeAR technology into their packaging processes. For consumers, DeAR will offer a 
convenient and secure way to verify the authenticity of products and track their shipments.




### Mission

DeStore aims to empower brands to adopt Web3 commerce and become self-sovereign. We are a technology service provider facilitating convenient and secure Direct To Customer (DTC) sales. DeStore enables DTC settlement by merging hybrid products and payment

### Vision

Our vision paints a future where brand holders seize complete control over promoting and selling their products, shaping their self-sovereign destiny in the digital world. Our central goal is to bridge the gap between traditional real-life products and the 
revolutionary world of blockchain-based Digital Twins, unlocking new immersive product-based experiences, leading to unprecedented growth and expansion opportunities.
We firmly believe that the future of commerce lies in the transformative power of Web3 technology. We are determined to grow alongside the continuous evolution of this field. By leveraging the latest advancements and dismantling barriers, we strive to 
contribute to an all-inclusive and efficient Web3 ecosystem, propelling businesses and individuals to flourish.
