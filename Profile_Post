# DeStore Network - **A Hybrid Marketplace - Roam Free**

## Objective: 

The DeStore platform aims to facilitate the adoption and management of Hybrid assets, which are physical assets connected to a **Digital Twin**. NFT technology for product based settlement, DeStore enables the creation, 
management, and trading of these assets, with the goal of providing pathways for small to medium enterprises (**SMEs**), **Creators**, and decentralized autonomous organizations (**DAOs**) to expand their brand 
and sell real-world products on web 3.0 infrastructure.

## Methods:

DeStore utilizes static digital twins and tokenization to represent the underlying physical assets. Digital twins allow for real-time monitoring and analysis of assets, while tokenization enables the creation of 
smart contracts for efficient automation of processes and reduces the need for intermediaries. By combining multiple digital files to a single asset, the platform allows for flexibility in asset representation across 
different platforms and the transfer of product information at the point of sale.

## Expected Outcomes: 

With the widespread adoption of digitization of assets, DeStore plans to greatly impact the way physical assets are managed and utilized. Real-time monitoring and optimization of performance, maintenance, and 
operation of assets can be achieved, as well as the autonomy of exchanging all product information at the point of sale of underlying assets.

## Impact:

The DeStore platform and the wider adoption of phygital assets can lead to reduced costs and increased efficiency in the SME economy, Creator economy, and DAO economy.
